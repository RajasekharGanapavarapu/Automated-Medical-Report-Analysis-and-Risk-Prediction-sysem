# Automated Medical Report Analysis and Risk Prediction System
🩺 Automated Medical Report Analysis and Risk Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

The Automated Medical Report Analysis and Risk Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to analyze unstructured medical reports and predict potential health risks.
The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification models to extract meaningful insights from medical text data and assist in early risk identification.

This project demonstrates how AI can support healthcare professionals by reducing manual analysis and improving decision-making efficiency.
